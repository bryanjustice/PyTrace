# PyTrace
Ray Tracing using Python and Inkscape
## What are my goals?
1. Be able to render diagrams and draw vectors in Inkscape via a Python script.
2. Be able to set electromagnetic material properties via a custom Python library (fully complex permittivity and permeability).
3. Be able to import geometries representing materials and shapes with their constituent properties attached.
4. Do simple ray tracing by importing the ray trajectories based on a Python simulation
5. Create more complex structures (such as a gradient index or Luneberg lens) to demonstrate Fermat's theorem and investigate what level of discretization still allows for the gradient and rays to behave as though it were continuous. 
## Installation requirements
### Numpy
[Numpy](numpy.org) is a python library that deals with arrays, matrices, and linear algebra among features.
### Inkscape software
[Inkscape](inkscape.org) is a vector graphics software package that will be useful in rendering ray tracing diagrams.
